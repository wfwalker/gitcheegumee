    - Saginaw Bay Dirigible Station
    - The grand central terminal of the Saginaw Bay Dirigible Station. Its once proud stone blocks struggle against the encroaching Solanum americanum. You can almost hear the roots prying the stone blocks apart

    - Pamphleteer's kiosk
    - A somewhat run-down booth that has barely enough room for an elderly woman, and a wide selection of pamphlets. The woman is knitting something that appears to be a mitten.

    - Sanctuary Vestibule
    - Like the entry to a cathedral, this small room has a high ceiling, stone walls, and a floor inlaid with ceramic tiles.

    - Municipal Sanctuary
    - |-
      A soaring hallway with tall stone pillars, heavy wooden benches, and colorful tapestries hanging on the walls. An offering box stands to the left of the central aisle. Almost half of the sanctuary is filled by the organ works. 
      
      Many people carry supplies to and from the organ. They seem to be fixing or somehow maintaining it.

    - Ole Pumper XVII portal
    - |-
      An unassuming door, with a red and green coat of arms showing two people working a heavy machine with a lever like a teeter-totter.
      
      A pleasant man says "I am sorry, but the Orgelbaumeister is not here today."

    - Ole Pumper XVII archive
    - "Swaying stacks of paper perch perilously on top of two or three pieces of furniture: a desk, a bookcase, a chair. Underfoot is a thick layer of individual sheets of paper, some of which appear to be growing together."

    - One dripping shower head, in the corner five tall gray lockers, two sinks and a full-length mirror. Each locker stands open, and has a name carved deeply into the door.

    - Ole Pumper XVII crow's nest
    - A long lever, resting on a fulcrum and attached to brass rods that descend through slots in the floor. There is room for two people, one at each end of the lever. The hand grips on each end of the lever appear to be plated in silver.

    - Ole Pumper XVII console
    - A long bench with two metal rails stands in front of an immense keyboard, and rows and rows of stops. A low-backed wooden chair, bound in brass, rides on the rails, permitting speedy movement from one side of the controls to the other. One set of keys runs the entire length of the console, while other keyboards and sets of pedals are more conventionally sized. An astounding work of heartbreaking craftsmanship.
